> On this page, you can learn how to setup the basics of Ducky, including a custom prefix and a Moderator/Administrator role.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Register your Guild">
    By running the `/setup` command, Ducky indexes/registers your guild into the database. 
  </Step>
  <Step title="Modify your Prefix">
    Ducky's default prefix is `d!`. Remember: Slash commands are always available! If you would like to modify the prefix for your server, you can run `/prefix <newPrefix>`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure a Moderator/Administrator Role">
    Many commands require configured role permissions. The Moderator role can run `/role add/remove/info`, `/warn`, `/kick`, `/mute`, and a few more. You can check command permissions by running `/help <command>`. To configure a Moderator or Administrator role, run `/setup` and press the **`>`** button below the pagination once. You will see the **Discord Moderation** setup page, which is where you can configure the Moderator/Administrator role. Each setup page has embed descriptions explaining what each component (select menus/buttons) does, and what it modifies.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Saving Configuration">
    Ducky automatically saves your configurations the moment you modify them.
